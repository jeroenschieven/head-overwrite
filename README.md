# Part of Head is removed client-side
This project is created to reproduce an issue with the next/head component where content in the head component is partly removed when added via a component(SeoHead).

When the content is directly added into the Head component, the content is not removed.

See both examples on `/overwritten` and `/not-overwritten`

## Context
We are running a headless WordPress installation and rendering all the content in a Nextjs app. For Seo purposes we render the full head, provided by the Yoast CMS plugin. This 'full head' is just a html string returned from the WP API.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
